# FE Capstone Project - Currency Coverter React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Capstone Part 1: Idea & Planning Phase

# Step 1: Project Definition and Understanding
Project: Currency Converter
I will be building a simple but powerful tool that allows users to convert money from one currency to another using real-time exchange rates.
Real-World Use Case:
This project thinks about travelers, online shoppers or remote freelancers who need to convert currency before making payments or decisions. This project has practical value and is easy to explain to others (like interviewers or classmates).

# Step 2: Project clarification and  Requirements
This project goals are broken down into small pieces to make it easy for me to build:

App Requirements:

- Integrate free public currency API like ExchangeRate.host
- Let the user select two currencies (From âž¡ To)
- Let the user enter the amount they want to convert
- Show the converted result
- Style using Tailwind CSS for a responsive, modern look
- Deploye on Vercel or Netlify so others can view it


# Step 3: Setting a Personal Goal
Before jumping into code, I asked myself certain questions:
- What do I want to segment my learning journey with this project?
- How can I challenge myself just enough without feeling overwhelmed?

- Answer:
I want to prove that I can build a working app from scratch and understand coding basics as a beginner and show that I am a working progress. I've learned React and Tailwind, now I want to show I can use them in a real project.This project will help me understand APIs and prepare me for real-world frontend work.

# Capstone Part 2: Designing on Figma
Here I came up with the kind of design I will be going in for and I came up with four main pages and they are : Signup, login ,landing page and currency converter pages.
Find the link to my design here https://www.figma.com/proto/ZNWP524pXJ3zPETiwxw07d/ALX--Currency-Converter-Project?

# Capstone Part 3: Start Building
# Basic Setups 
- Set up your React project and basic layout.
- Create React App with Vite
- Set up Tailwind CSS
   Follow official Tailwind + Vite setup: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite


## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
